1. **os**: A standard Python library that provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.

2. **typing**: A module that provides support for type hints, which helps in indicating the expected data types of function parameters and return values, making the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series that allow for handling and analyzing structured data easily.

4. **numpy**: A library for numerical computations in Python. It offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

5. **torch**: The core library of PyTorch, which is an open-source deep learning framework. It provides advanced tensor computation capabilities and automatic differentiation for building and training neural networks.

6. **torch.nn**: A submodule of PyTorch that provides classes and functions to build neural network architectures easily. It includes layers, loss functions, and other utilities for model building.

7. **torch.utils.data**: A module that provides classes like Dataset and DataLoader, which are essential for loading and batching data in a PyTorch-friendly manner.

8. **pytorch_lightning**: A lightweight wrapper around PyTorch that helps in organizing deep learning code by abstracting away repetitive tasks like training loops and logging, making it easier to scale and manage models.

9. **networkx**: A library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks and graphs. It's utilized in your code to handle the construction and analysis of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

10. **sklearn**: The scikit-learn library, specifically its model_selection module, which is used for splitting datasets into training and test sets, enabling better model evaluation.

11. **tqdm**: A library for creating progress bars in Python. It can wrap around iterable objects to show the progress of loops or other iterable processes.

12. **crunch**: A custom library presumably defined elsewhere in your project or environment. It's being used to load data and provide notebook functionalities, but specific details would depend on its implementation.
